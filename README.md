# Smart_Farm

## Introduction

This is a controller design project of a smart farm. It contains a function that only the farm should have, such as the use of common temperature and humidity sensors, the use of distance sensors, and so on. A RGB screen plus touch is used for human-computer interaction, and users can control various functions on the farm by controlling the touch screen. The project originated from the financial support of the Daiso project of the Pearl River College of South China Agricultural University. Now according to the plan, the high-performance i.MX RT1052 is used as the master control. The follow-up will optimize and support more MCUs, including the low-end Performance, such as STM32F103RC and so on.
